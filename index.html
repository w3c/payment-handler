  <p>The Payment Request API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] provides
    a standard way to initiate payment requests from Web pages and
    applications. User agents implementing that API prompt the user
    to select a way to handle the payment request, after which
    the user agent returns a payment response to the originating site.
    This specification adds <strong>payment apps</strong>
    to that user experience. It defines how users
    register payment apps with user agents, how user agents support the display of
    information about payment apps the user can select to handle the
    payment request, how the user selects a payment app, and how communication takes
    place between user agents and payment apps to fulfill the requirements of the
    underlying Payment Request API.</p>

        This draft highlights some of the pending issues that are still to
        be discussed in the working group. No decision has been taken on
        the outcome of these issues including whether they are valid. Pull

<section class='informative'>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The Web Payments Working Group seeks to streamline payments on the Web to
  help reduce payment "abandonment" and make it easier to use
  new payment methods on the Web. It has published the Payment Request
  API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] as a standard way to initiate payment
  requests from Web pages and applications. This specification adds
    payment apps to that user experience. A payment app is software that
    enables the user to fulfill a payment request using the user's
    preferred payment method.</p>

    <p>This specification defines:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How users register and unregister payment apps with the user agent.</li>
      <li>How the user agent matches payment methods supported by the payee with those enabled in registered payment apps.</li>
      <li>How the user agent displays information about payment apps to the user for selection.</li>
      <li>How the user agent invokes a payment app, communicates input/response data with it, and returns the response data to the underlying Payment Request API.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Payment apps may be implemented in a variety of ways: as Web applications, native operating system applications,
      user agent extensions, built-in user agent components, interface-less Web services, or a combination.
      This specification does not cover every aspect of communication on every platform.</p>
  <p class="note" title="User agent as payment request mediator">The Web Payments Working Group has used the term
      "mediator" to refer to the software (here, the user agent) that carries out the activities defined in this
      specification (matching, information display, etc.).</p>

<section id='conformance'>
    <p>
        This specification defines one class of products:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>Conforming user agent</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                A <a>user agent</a> MUST behave as described in this specification
                in order to be considered conformant. In this specification, <a>user agent</a> means a <em>Web
                browser or other interactive user agent</em> as defined in [[!HTML5]].
            </p>
            <p>
                User agents MAY implement algorithms given in this
                specification in any way desired, so long as the end result is
                indistinguishable from the result that would be obtained by the
                specification's algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
                A conforming Payment App API user agent MUST also be a
                <em>conforming implementation</em> of the IDL fragments
                of this specification, as described in the
                “Web IDL” specification. [[!WEBIDL]]
            </p>

            <aside class="note">
                This specification uses both the terms "conforming user agent(s)"
                and "user agent(s)" to refer to this product class.

  <h2>Payment App Model and Design Considerations</h2>
  <p>This section (which may be temporary) intends to help build shared understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the specified model.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>General Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>This specification builds on PaymentRequest API.</li>
      <li>It defines mechanisms that may be used to support both Web-based and <a>native payment apps</a>. However, we anticipate
          that the ecosystem will also include proprietary approaches to some of the functionality defined here
          (e.g., for payment app registration or invocation).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Decoupling and Trust</h3>
    <ul>
<li>    A goal of this system is to decouple the payment methods used to pay from the software (payment apps) that implement those payment methods. By decoupling, merchants (and their payment service providers) can lower the cost of creating a checkout experience, users can have more choice in the software they use to pay, and payment app providers can innovate without imposing an integration burden on merchants.</li>
<li>User choice of payment apps that support a given payment method will depend in part on the willingness of the payment method owner to license implementations (e.g., via a manifest other mechanism). For example, there may only be one app authorized to support a payment method owned by a company, while there may be many apps that support basic credit card payments or credit transfers.</li>
<li>    For privacy, the design should limit information about the user's environment available to merchant without user consent. That includes which payment apps the user has registered. The merchant should not receive information about which payment app the user selected to pay unless the user consents to share that information; of course when there is only one payment app for a given payment method that information is already publicly known. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/browser-payment-api/issues/224">issue 224</a> for discussion about how merchant may track progress of a push payment.</li>
<li>    Although decoupling relieves merchants of implementing some aspects of the checkout experience, one consequence is that they give up some degree of control. This was already the case for some payment methods, but for traditional card payments, merchants (or their PSPs) will be entrusting some portion of data collection to the browser or third party payment apps.</li>
<li>The design therefore includes support for merchants to recommend payment apps and suggest the ordering of payment methods. The design should endeavor not to constrain how user agents make use of this information, only provide guidance to user agent makers about taking into account both merchant and user preferences.</li>
<li>Here are preferences the system might support:
  <ul>
<li>        Accepted payment methods (payment methods the merchant accepts, and no others may be used; part of payment request API)</li>
<li>        Preferred payment methods (payee-specified order part of payment request API)</li>
<li>        Recommended payment apps (payment apps the merchant prefers, but others may be used)</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li> The user agent can use this information in conjunction with user preferences to:
  <ul>
    <li>   Filter payment apps (to matching payment methods)</li>
<li>        Order payment apps (according to merchant specified order)</li>
<li>        Display recommended payment apps (according to merchant-recommended payment app order)</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Registration and Unregistration</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Registration provides a way for user agents
	to remain aware of the user's payment apps across transactions.</li>
      <li>Registration is not a
	prerequisite for using a payment app. In particular, a user
	should be able to pay with a merchant-recommended payment app
	that the user has not yet registered. Note: this implies
	that payment apps (at least in some cases) should be designed
	to process requests without assuming prior registration.
	There may also be security implications (since we expect to
	rely on origin information as a security mechanism at registration).</li>
      <li>The payee should provide all data necessary to display and invoke a
        recommended payment app in the payment request. Invocation of a payment
        app that is not registered can use the same mechanism as a registered
        payment app except all data should be considered ephemeral and the user
        agent does not remember the app.</li>
      <li>When registration is desired it might happen in a variety of ways:
	<ul>
	  <li>This working group will define an API available for all types of payment apps.</li>
	  <li>Native apps and user agents may have platform-specific ways to achieve the same (or similar) result.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>We expect registrations to happen at various times (e.g., outside and inside of checkout), and with differing levels of
          user consent to modify their configuration within the user agent. In general, explicit consent should not be required
          while the user is within the context of the payment request UI. Here are some examples:
        <ul>
          <li>When the merchant recommends a payment app and the user selects it, registration can happen in that moment without
              additional user action or consent. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-payment-apps-api/issues/34#issuecomment-245431139">notes from Rouslan</a> on registration upon selection of recommended payment app.</li>
          <li>When browser recommends a payment app and the user selects it, registration can happen in that moment without additional user action or consent.</li>
          <li>When the user installs native payment app, registration could happen either through platform-specific mechanisms (or through this standard API) without additional user action beyond installation.</li>
          <li>Users visiting a Web site (e.g., merchant or bank) may wish to explicitly register payment apps, which would require explicit
              consent from the user. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-payment-apps-api/issues/34#issuecomment-245431139">notes from Rouslan</a> on gating registration on user activation.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>During registration as defined in this specification, information about enabled payment methods and display details of the payment app is provided to the user agent.
          The user agent stores this information for subsequent actions (e.g., when matching payee-accepted payment methods). In this
          proposal, there are no requirements for a payment app to be able to respond to user agent queries for updated
          registration information. In this proposal, payment apps update the information that a user agent has stored about them
          by re-calling the registration API. (See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-payment-apps-api/issues/36">issue 36</a>.)</li>
      <li>We expect user agents to distinguish themselves in how they balance different ease of registration and security.</li>
      <li>It is important for merchants and users to be able to trust the
	authenticity of payment apps. A starting point is to rely on origin information (e.g., if a payment app is registered on a Web site). In contexts where origin binding is not available (e.g., native payment apps) other mechanisms should be considered to help establish authenticity (e.g., origin-bound confirmation of a digital signature of a native payment app).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Payment App Identification</h3>
    <ul>
<li>    For recommended payment apps we will need <a>payment app identifiers</a> (PAIs). See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-payment-apps-api/issues/35#issuecomment-245747771">discussion around issue 35</a>.</li>
<li>    A PAI should include origin information. This origin information may be used in a variety of ways:
  <ul>
<li>        The origin information could enable user agents to provide the user with useful services when the user is browsing a site with the same origin (e.g., putting that payment app at the top of a list or otherwise highlighted).</li>
<li>        For a payment method with an associated origin, the user agent can do some (security) checks by comparing the origin of the payment method and any authorized payment app.</li>
  </ul>
<li>    A PAI should allow for granularity (e.g., payment app versioning) in the form of constrained URLs. <strong>Note:</strong> The Working Group is discussing a constrained syntax for payment method identifiers (e.g., origin, case-sensitive path, no trailing slash) and we should consider aligning with that preference.</li>
</ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Payment App Matching</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>When the user invokes the Payment Request API (e.g., by "pushing the Buy button"), the user agent
          computes the intersection between payee-accepted payment methods and user-registered payment methods. It
          does this by comparing Payment Request API data (from the payee) and data provided during registration,
          invoking the comparison algorithm defined in
          [[!METHOD-IDENTIFIERS]]. The result is a list of
          matching payment apps and recommended payment apps.</li>
      <li>Using information provided during registration (e.g., an app name or icon),the user agent displays matching
          payment apps for selection by the user. The user agent may also display merchant-recommended and user-agent-recommended payment apps, which are
          displayed distinctly for the user. This mechanism is intended to support use cases such as a merchant
          recommending their own payment app or one they trust to the user.
	<p class="note" title="User Agent selection features not in scope">The user agent may offer features to facilitate selection (e.g., launch a chosen payment app every time the user wants to pay at a given Web site); those features lie outside the scope of this specification.</p></li>
      <li>The user selects a payment app to make a payment. The user may also select a recommended payment app.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>User Experience</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The system should minimize user interaction for payment app registration, payment app selection, and payment credentials selection. Ideas include:
	<ul>
	  <li>When only one payment app matches, the user agent does not require user selection to launch it.</li>
	  <li>The user agent displays payment options for direct selection by the user. For example, instead of merely displaying information about a payment app that supports cards, the user agent could display some representation of individual registered cards. If the user can select an option directly, that could contribute to reducing the total number of required user actions. </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>It is likely that this specification will include <em>guidance</em> rather than requirements about specific user experience optimizations.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Payment App Invocation and Response</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Based on information provided at registration, the user agent "launches" the payment app and provides it with
        input data drawn from the Payment Request API. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-payment-apps-api/issues/24">issue 24</a> for information about launching the payment app in a secure context.</li>
      <li>The user may interact with the payment app in a variety of ways to authorize payment, cancel the transaction,
          or carry out other activities supported by the payment app. This specification does not address payment app
          behavior other than accepting requests and returning responses to the user agent.</li>
      <li>This specification defines a means for the user agent to receive a response asynchronously once the user has
          authorized payment. The response becomes the response of the Payment Request API.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Network Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>This specification only describes communication between the
          user agent and the payment app. This includes an
          asynchronous mechanism for a payment app to return a payment
          response to the user agent. This specification does not
          (yet) address scenarios where the user agent does not
          receive the response (e.g., due to a crash or network
        outage). Network failure may be especially problematic in the
	case of a push payment; see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/browser-payment-api/issues/224">issue 224</a>, and so the Working Group is considering whether the specification should include a standard way to learn how to query a component for payment state information. For example, many systems use backchannel communications, so one idea is for the payee to provide a callback URL. This would allow (but not require) the payment app to communicate with the payee server until such time as all parties are satisfied they share the same view of the payment response. An alternative would be to provide the payment app and the user agent a channel so that communication continues until all parties are satisfied they share the same view of the payment response. This might involve caching payment responses.</li>
      <li>This specification does not address communication between the payee server and the payee Web app, or between
          the payment app and other parties (e.g., the payment app distributor, or directly to the merchant).</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Overview of Service-Worker-Based Approach</h2>

<p>In this specification we use <a>service workers</a>
    to connect user agents with user agent-based payment apps. We do so for
    several reasons:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Service workers provide a cleanly isolated execution context that allows
        the <a>payment app</a> to run with clean separation from the
        <a>payee</a> website.
      </li>
      <li>We can leverage the ways in which service workers already
          handle lifecycle management (registration, update, and removal of
          <a>payment apps</a>), enable offline use, etc.</li>
      <li>We can leverage service worker origins for security, especially
          when used in conjunction with origins associated with <a>payment
          method identifiers</a>.</li>
    </ul>

<p class="note">
  The use of service workers restricts <a>user agent-based payment apps</a> so
  that they must run only in secure contexts. The introduction of this
  restriction is deliberate, due to the sensitivity of the role that payment
  apps play.
</p>

<p>Here is the flow envisioned by this document:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Through registration, a <a>service worker</a> is created and
        associated with <a>payment methods</a>
        (and associated metadata).</li>
    <li>When the <code>payment request API</code> is called, the user agent
        displays a list of registered service workers associated
        with matching payment methods (along with any other payment apps
        that may be available to the user agent).</li>
    <lI>When the user selects a <a>user agent-based payment
        app</a>, the corresponding <a>service worker</a> is activated, and
        it receives a <a>PaymentRequestEvent</a>.</li>
    <li>Once active, the <a>payment app</a> performs whatever steps are
        necessary to authenticate the user, process the payment, and return
        payment information to the <a>payee</a>. If interaction with the user
        is necessary, the <a>payment app</a> can open a <a>payment app
        window</a> for that purpose.</li>
    <li>Finally, once the <a>payment app</a> is finished with its processing, it
        resolves a <a>Promise</a> passed to it in the event. This causes the
        <code>Promise&lt;PaymentResponse&gt;</code> returned from
        <code>PaymentRequest.show()</code> to resolve.</li>

    <h3>Payment App Invocation</h3>
    <p>
      <a>Payment apps</a> are invoked when a <a>payee</a> requests a payment
      by calling <code>PaymentRequest.show()</code> and the user selects a
      payment app (or has one implicitly selected by previously established
      user preferences). If the user selects a <a>user agent-based payment
      app</a> to service the request, the <a>service worker</a> corresponding
      to that application receives an event with the
      <a>PaymentAppRequestData</a> containing information about the payment
      being requested. The event also contains a function that allows the
      payment app to provide a <a>payment response</a> back to the
      <a>payee</a>. This process is formally described in the following
      sections.

  <h3>
    Payment App Display
  </h3>
    <p>
      Payment Apps that require user input can open a payment window using the
      <code>clients.openWindow()</code> method defined in [[!SERVICE-WORKERS]].
      Absent user preferences that override such behavior, user interaction is
      required during payment requests, in the form of payment app selection. As
      a consequence, the user agent MUST treat a <a>paymentrequest</a> event as
      user interaction for the purposes of determining whether the <a>service
      worker</a> is allowed to open a window.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      The actual rendering of a <a>payment app window</a> is a user agent
      implementation detail. While opening an entirely new window is possible,
      it is more likely that the contents will be rendered in a way that makes
      it more obvious that the interactions pertain to the payment
      transaction. This is an area for potential user agent experimentation
      and differentiation. The opening of a <a>payment app window</a> versus
      other types of windows can be distinguished based on the event type the
      user agent is using to grant permission to open a window.
    </p>
    <p><em>The remainder of this section is a non-normative explanation of how
    the service worker <code>WindowClient</code> class can be used to interact
    with users.</em></p>
    <p>
      Upon calling clients.openWindow(), the payment app receives a
      <a>Promise</a> which resolves to a <code>WindowClient</code>. For the
      purposes of this discussion, we will refer to this
      <code>WindowClient</code> as <var>client</var>.  The payment app can use
      the <var>client</var>.<code>postMessage()</code> method to send messages
      to the <a>payment app window</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a <a>payment app window</a> receives the <code>message</code> event
      from the payment app, this event will contain a <code>source</code>
      attribute which indicates the payment app's service worker. The payment
      app window can then call <code>source.postMessage()</code> to send a
      response to the payment app. Once the payment app window has complete its
      interaction with the user, it closes the window and uses this
      <code>postMessage()</code> call to return information to the payment app.
    </p>
    <p class="issue">
      In order for this approach to work, we have to treat a
      <a>paymentrequest</a> as permission to open a popup, which is a formal
      property relied up on by [[!SERVICE-WORKERS]]. We need to be careful
      that this does not become an end-run around exiting pop-up protections.
    </p>
    <p class="issue">
      Do we want to define a new <code>FrameType</code> for <a>payment app
      window</a>s? This requires input from someone with detailed knowledge of
      service worker design.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="sec-payment-app-response">
    <h3>Payment App Response</h3>
    <p>
      The user agent receives a successful response from the payment app
      through resolution of the Promise provided to the <code>respondWith</code>
      function of the corresponding <a>PaymentRequestEvent</a> dictionary.
      The application is expected to resolve the Promise with a
      <code>PaymentResponse</code> dictionary instance containing the payment
      response information. In case of user cancellation or error, the
      application may signal failure by rejecting the Promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Promise is rejected, the user agent MUST run the <dfn>payment app
      failure algorithm</dfn>. The exact details of this algorithm is left for
      user agent implementers to decide on. Acceptable behaviors include,
      but are not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Letting the user try again, with the same payment app or with a
        different one.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rejecting the Promise that was created by
        <code>PaymentRequest.show()</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If this Promise is successfully resolved, the user agent MUST run the
      <a>user accepts the payment request algorithm</a> as defined in
      [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]], replacing steps 6 and 7 with these steps or
      their equivalent:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Set <var>appResponse</var> to the <code>PaymentResponse</code> used to
        resolve the <a>PaymentRequestEvent</a><code>.respondWith</code> Promise.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>appResponse</var>.<code>methodName</code> is not present or
        not set to one of the values from
        <a>PaymentRequestEvent</a>.<code>data</code>, run the <a>payment app
        failure algorithm</a> and terminate these steps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a <a>structured clone</a> of
        <var>appResponse</var>.<code>methodName</code>
        and assign it to
        <var>response</var>.<code>methodName</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>appResponse</var>.<code>details</code> is not present, run the
        <a>payment app failure algorithm</a> and terminate these steps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a <a>structured clone</a> of

        and assign it to

      See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-payment-apps-api/issues/37">issue 37</a> for discussion of payment app cancellation and also resulting user agent behavior. At the 23 November 2016 payment apps task force meeting, there was consensus that in case of payment app failure or cancelation, the user agent should not be prohibited from offering the user alternative matching payment apps.</p>

    card</em> scheme might look like the following:</p>
    <pre class="example highlight" title="Simple Payment App Window">
&lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;form id="form"&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Card Number:&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input name="card_number"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Expiration Month:&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input name="expiry_month"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Expiration Year:&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input name="expiry_year"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;CVV:&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input name="cvv"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Pay"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
window.addEventListener("message", function(e) {
  var form = document.getElementById("form");
  /* Note: message sent from payment app is available in e.data */
  form.onsubmit = function() {
    var details = {};
    ["card_number","expiry_month","expiry_year","cvv"].forEach(function(field) {
      details[field] = form.elements[field].value;
    });
    e.source.postMessage({
      methodName: "basic-card#visa",
      details: details
    });
    window.close();
  }
});
&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;
    </pre>

  <h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>Design Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The API does not share information about the user's registered payment methods or payment apps with the payee. The only information that is shared is the result of user selection.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Secure Communications</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/#security-considerations">Service Worker security considerations</a></li>
      <li>Payment method security is outside the scope of this specification and is addressed by payment apps that support those payment methods.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Payment App Authenticity</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To avoid problems such as phishing-type attacks on payee sites, we want to be able to ensure the authenticity of payment apps. In general we expect to rely on origin information for establishing payment app authenticity. In contexts where payment apps are referenced other than on their origin, we are considering additional measures to help establish authenticity. Examples: validate a digital signature prior to launching a recommended app or an installed native app without associated origin information.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Data Validation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Payees should validate that the data they have received through the paymentRequest API is what they expect (e.g., the total that was paid, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Private Browsing Mode</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>When the Payment Request API is invoked in a "private browsing mode," the user agent should launch user agent-based payment apps in a private context. This will generally prevent sites from accessing any previously-stored information. In turn, this is likely to require either that the user log in to the payment app or re-enter payment instrument details.</li>
    </ul>
