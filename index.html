  <p>Payment Request API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] provides a standard

        This draft highlights some of the pending issues that are still to
        be discussed in the working group. No decision has been taken on
        the outcome of these issues including whether they are valid. Pull

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The Web Payments Working Group seeks to streamline payments on the Web to
  help reduce "shopping cart abandonment" and make it easier to deploy
  new payment methods on the Web. It has published the Payment Request
  API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] as a standard way to initiate payment
    requests from E-Commerce Web sites and applications.</p>

  <p>A <dfn id="payment-app">payment app</dfn> is a Web application that manages
  payment requests on behalf of the user by supporting one or more
    payment methods. To enable a Web application to handle payment requests,
    this specification defines:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>How origins (i.e., Web sites) request permission to handle payment requests
      on the user's behalf.</li>
    <li>How origins register their support for different payment methods
      with the user agent.</li>
    <li>How origins provide information to faciliate the display of
      payment options for selection by the user.</li>
    <li>How user agents invoke and exchange data with payment handlers from an origin.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This specification does not address how software built with
      operating-system specific mechanisms (e.g., "native mobile
      apps") handle payment requests.</p>
</section>

<section id='conformance'>
    <p>
        This specification defines one class of products:
    </p>

        <dd>
            <p>
                A <a>user agent</a> MUST behave as described in this specification
                in order to be considered conformant. In this specification, <a>user agent</a> means a <em>Web
                browser or other interactive user agent</em> as defined in [[!HTML5]].
            </p>
            <p>
                User agents MAY implement algorithms given in this
                specification in any way desired, so long as the end result is
                indistinguishable from the result that would be obtained by the
                specification's algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
                A conforming Payment Handler API user agent MUST also be a
                <em>conforming implementation</em> of the IDL fragments
                of this specification, as described in the
                “Web IDL” specification. [[!WEBIDL]]

  <h2>Overview of Handling Payment Requests</h2>

  <p>In this document we envision the following flow:</p>

  <ol>

    <li>An origin requests permission from the user to handle payment
      requests for a set of supported payment methods. For example,
      a user visiting a retail or bank site may be prompted to register
      a payment handler from that origin. The user agent is not required to
      prompt the user to grant permission
    to the origin for each new supported payment method. A origin's
    capabilities may thus evolve without requiring additional user
      consent.</li>
    
    <li>To handle payments, an
      origin has at least one and possibly many service worker
      registrations. A service worker registration has zero or one
      payment handler.
    </li>

    <li>Registration associates with each payment handler:
      <ul>
	<li>A list of supported payment methods.</li>
	<li>[Optionally] the conditions under which the handler supports a given payment method; these "capabilities" play a role in matching computations.</li>
	<li>Information for organizing the display and grouping of Options
	  supported by the payment handler.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>When the merchant calls Payment Request API
      (e.g., when the user pushes a button on a checkout page), the
      user agent computes a list of matching payment handlers, comparing
      the payment methods accepted by the user with those supported
      by registered payment handlers. For payment methods that support
      additional filtering, merchant and payment handler capabilities are
      compared as part of determining whether there is a match.</li>

    <li>The user agent displays matching payment handlers, displaying
      and grouping Options according to information (labels and
      icons) provided at registration or otherwise available from
      the Web app.</li>

    <li>When the user selects an Option, the user agent fires the
    paymentrequest event in the service worker whose registration
    included the payment handler that provided that Option.  The
      paymentrequest event includes some information from the PaymentRequest
      (defined in [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]])
      as well as additional information (e.g., origin and selected Option).
    <li>Once activated, the payment handler performs whatever steps are
        necessary to authenticate the user, process the payment, and return
        payment information to the <a>payee</a>. If interaction with the user
        is necessary, the <a>payment handler</a> can open a window
        for that purpose.</li>

    <li>The user agent receives a response asynchronously once the
      user has authorized payment. The response becomes the
      PaymentResponse (of [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]]).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This specification does not address activities outside this flow, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>how the user establishes an account with an origin that provides payment services.</li>
    <li>how an origin authenticates a user.</li>
    <li>how communication takes place between the payee server and the payee Web application, or between a payment app origin and other parties.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Thus, an origin will rely on many other Web technologies defined
    elsewhere for lifecycle management, security, user authentication,
    user interaction, and so on.</p>

    <h3>
      Extensions to the <a>ServiceWorkerRegistration</a> interface
    </h3>
      <p>
        The Service Worker specification defines a <code>ServiceWorkerRegistration</code> interface
        [[!SERVICE-WORKERS]], which this specification extends.
      </p>
      <pre id="service-worker-registration-idl" class="idl">

          readonly attribute PaymentAppManager paymentAppManager;

  <h2>
    <a>PaymentAppManager</a> interface

      <pre id="payment-app-manager-idl" class="idl">
      interface PaymentAppManager {
        attribute PaymentAppOptions options;
        attribute PaymentWallets wallets;
      };
      </pre>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>options</code> attribute</dt>
      <dd>
        This attribute allows manipulation of payment options associated with a
        payment handler. To be presented to the user as part of the payment request
        flow, payment handlers must have at least one registered payment option, and
        that option needs to match the payment methods and required capabilities
        specified by the payment request.
        <p class="issue">Is "options" the right term here? We don't want this to
        get conflated with "PaymentOptions" in the payment request
        specification. Other alternatives might be "instruments" or "accounts."
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt><code>wallets</code> attribute</dt>
      <dd>
        This attribute allows payment handlers to group payment options together and
        provide a name and icon for such a group (e.g., to group together
        "business account" payment instruments separately from "personal
        account" payment instruments). The use of this grouping mechanism
        by payment handlers is completely optional. If payment handlers use this
        grouping mechanism, then matching payment options that do not appear
        in any groups should still be presented to users by the browser for
        selection.

<section id="option-display-ordering">
  <h2>Origin and Option Display for Selection</h2>
  <p>After applying the matching algorithm defined in Payment Request API,
    the user agent displays a list of matching origins for the user to make
    a selection. This specification includes a limited number of display
    requirements; most user experience details are left to user agents.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>Ordering of Payment Handlers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The user agent <span class='rfc2119'>MUST</span> favor user-side order preferences (based on user configuration or behavior) over payee-side order preferences.</li>
      <li>The user agent <span class='rfc2119'>MUST</span> display matching payment handlers in an order that corresponds to the order of supported payment methods provided by the payee, except where overridden by user-side order preferences.</li>
      <li>The user agent <span class='rfc2119'>SHOULD</span> allow the user to configure the display of matching payment handlers to control the ordering and define preselected defaults.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following are examples of payment handler ordering:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For a given Web site, display payment handlers in an order that reflects usage patterns for the site (e.g., a frequently used payment handler at the top, or the most recently used payment handler at the top).</li>
      <li>Enable the user to set a preferred order for a given site or for all sites.</li>
      <li>If the origin of the site being visited by the user matches the origin of a payment handler, show the payment handler at the top of the list.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Display of Options</h3>
    <p>The user agent  <span class='rfc2119'>MUST</span> enable the user to select any displayed Option.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>At a minimum, we expect user agents to display an icon and label for each matching origin to help the user make a selection.</li>
      <li>In some contexts (e.g., a desktop browser) it may be possible to improve the user experience by offering additional detail to the user. For example, if the user's "bank.com" origin knows about two credit cards (thus, two potential responses to the same payment method "basic-card"), the user agent could display each credit card's brand and the last four digits of the card to remind the user which cards the origin knows about.</li>
    </ul>

    <p  class="issue" title="Isue 98 - display"><a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-payment-apps-api/issues/98">Issue 98</a>. There has been pushback to always requiring display of options (e.g., on a mobile devices). User agents can incrementally show options. Or user agents can return an empty option ID and it becomes the payment app's responsibility to display options to the user.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Grouping of Options</h3>

    <p>At times, the same origin may wish to group options with
      greater flexibility and granularity than merely "by origin." These
      use cases include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>White label wallets - one origin provides wallet services for multiple vendors</li>
      <li>Multiple user profiles with a single provider (e.g., business wallet vs personal wallet)</li>
      <li>Multiple instruments held with a single provider</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A <dfn id="wallet">Wallet</dfn> is a grouping of Options for
      display purposes.</p>

    <p>To enable developers to build payment apps in a variety of
    ways, we decouple the registration (and subsequent display) of
    Options from how payment handlers respond to paymentrequest
    events. However, the user agent is responsible for communicating
    the user's selection in the event.</p>
  </section>


  <section>
    <h3>Selection of Options</h3>

    <p>Users agents may wish to enable the user to select individual displayed Options. The payment handler would receive information about the selected option and could take action, potentially eliminating an extra click (first open the payment app then select the option). </p>

    <p class="issue" title="Isue 98 - selection"><a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-payment-apps-api/issues/98">Issue 98</a>. Should we require that, if displayed, individual Options must be selectable? Or should we allow flexibility that Options may be displayed, but selecting any one invokes all registered payment handlers? One idea that has been suggested: the user agent (e.g., on a mobile device) could first display the app-level icon/logo. Upon selection, the user agent could display the Options in a submenu.</p>

  <h2>Payment Handler Invocation, Display and Response</h2>

  <h3>
    Payment Handler Windows
  </h3>

  <p>An invoked payment handler may or may not need to display information
    about itself or request user input. Some examples of potential
    payment handler displays include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The payment handler opens a window for the user to provide an authorization code.</li>
    <li>The payment handler opens a window that makes it easy for the user to confirm payment using default information for that site provided through previous user configuration.</li>
    <li>When first selected to pay in a given session, the payment handler
      opens a window. For subsequent payments in the same session, the payment handler (through configuration) performs its duties without opening a window or requiring user interaction.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="issue">See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-payment-apps-api/issues/97">issue 97</a> for discussion about opening window in a way that is consistent with payment flow and not confusing to the user. For example, there is consensus that in a desktop environment, a payment handler should <em>not</em> open a window in a new browser tab, as this is too dissociated from the checkout context.</p>
  
  <p>User agents SHOULD display the origin of a running payment handler to the user.</p>

  <section id="sec-payment-app-response">
    <h3>Payment App Response</h3>

    The <a>payment app response</a> is conveyed using the following
    dictionary:
    <pre class="idl">
      dictionary PaymentAppResponse {
        DOMString methodName;
        object details;
      };
    </pre>
    <dt><code>methodName</code> attribute</dt>
    <dd>
      The <a>payment method identifier</a> for the <a>payment method</a>
      that the user selected to fulfil the transaction.
    </dd>
    <dt><code>details</code> attribute</dt>
    <dd>
      A <a>JSON-serializable object</a> that provides a <a> payment
      method</a> specific message used by the merchant to process the
      transaction and determine successful fund transfer.
    </dd>
    
    <p>
      The user agent receives a successful response from the payment handler
      through resolution of the Promise provided to the <code>respondWith</code>
      function of the corresponding <a>PaymentRequestEvent</a> dictionary.
      The application is expected to resolve the Promise with a
      <code>PaymentAppResponse</code> instance containing the
      payment response. In case of user cancellation or error, the
      application may signal failure by rejecting the Promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Promise is rejected, the user agent MUST run the <dfn>payment app
      failure algorithm</dfn>. The exact details of this algorithm is left for
      user agent implementers to decide on. Acceptable behaviors include,
      but are not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Letting the user try again, with the same payment handler or with a
        different one.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rejecting the Promise that was created by
        <code>PaymentRequest.show()</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If this Promise is successfully resolved, the user agent MUST run the
      <a>user accepts the payment request algorithm</a> as defined in
      [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]], replacing steps 6 and 7 with these steps or
      their equivalent:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Set <var>appResponse</var> to the <code>PaymentAppResponse</code>
        instance used to resolve the
        <a>PaymentRequestEvent</a><code>.respondWith</code> Promise.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>appResponse</var>.<code>methodName</code> is not present or
        not set to one of the values from
        <a>PaymentRequestEvent</a>.<code>appRequest</code>, run the <a>payment app
        failure algorithm</a> and terminate these steps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a <a>structured clone</a> of
        <var>appResponse</var>.<code>methodName</code>
        and assign it to
        <var>response</var>.<code>methodName</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>appResponse</var>.<code>details</code> is not present, run the
        <a>payment app failure algorithm</a> and terminate these steps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a <a>structured clone</a> of
        <var>appResponse</var>.<code>details</code>
        and assign it to
        <var>response</var>.<code>details</code>.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The following example shows how to respond to a payment request:</p>
    <pre class="example highlight" title="Sending a Payment Response">
      paymentRequestEvent.respondWith(new Promise(function(accept,reject) {
        /* ... processing may occur here ... */
        accept({
          methodName: "basic-card#visa",
          details: {
            card_number :  "1232343451234",
            expiry_month : "12",
            expiry_year :  "2020",
            cvv :          "123"
           }
        });
      });
    </pre>

    <p class="note">
      [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] defines a <code>paymentRequestID</code>
	that parties in the ecosystem (including payment app providers
	and payees) may use for reconciliation after network or other
	failures.</p>

      <h3>Example of handling the <code>paymentrequest</code> event</h3>
    <p>
      This example shows how to write a service worker that listens to the
      paymentrequest event. When a payment request event is received, the
      service worker opens a window in order to interact with the user.
    </p>

<p class="issue">Per <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-payment-apps-api/issues/97">issue 97</a>, we expect <strong>not</strong> to use clients.OpenWindow and instead await a proposal for a new openClientWindow method. We will need to update these examples.</p>

    
    <pre class="example highlight" title="Handling the paymentrequest event"
    id="example-paymentrequest-event">
      self.addEventListener('paymentrequest', function(e) {
        e.respondWith(new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
          self.addEventListener('message', listener = function(e) {
            self.removeEventListener('message', listener);
            if (e.data.hasOwnProperty('name')) {
              reject(e.data);
            } else {
              resolve(e.data);
            }
          });

          clients.openWindow("https://www.example.com/bobpay/pay")
          .then(function(windowClient) {
            windowClient.postMessage(e.data);
          })
          .catch(function(err) {
            reject(err);
          });
        }));
      });
    </pre>
    <p>Using the simple scheme described above, a trivial HTML page that is
    loaded into the <a>payment handler window</a> to implement the <em>basic
    card</em> scheme might look like the following:</p>
    <pre class="example highlight" title="Simple Payment Handler Window">
&lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;form id="form"&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Cardholder Name:&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input name="cardholderName"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Card Number:&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input name="cardNumber"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Expiration Month:&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input name="expiryMonth"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Expiration Year:&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input name="expiryYear"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Security Code:&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input name="cardSecurityCode"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Pay"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
window.addEventListener("message", function(e) {
  var form = document.getElementById("form");
  /* Note: message sent from payment app is available in e.data */
  form.onsubmit = function() {
    /* See https://w3c.github.io/webpayments-methods-card/#basiccardresponse */
    var basicCardResponse = {};
    [ "cardholderName", "cardNumber","expiryMonth","expiryYear","cardSecurityCode"]

      basicCardResponse[field] = form.elements[field].value;
    });

    /* See https://w3c.github.io/webpayments-payment-apps-api/#sec-app-response */
    var paymentAppResponse = {
      methodName: "basic-card",
      details: details

    e.source.postMessage(paymentAppResponse);
    window.close();

  <h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>Information about the User Environment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The API does not share information about the user's registered payment handlers. Information from origins is only shared with the payee with the consent of the user.</li>
      <li>Similarly, user agents should not share payment request information with any payment handler until the user has selected that payment handler.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>User Consent before Payment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>One goal of this specification is to minimize the user interaction required to make a payment. At the same time, user agents must not permit combinations of configurations that would enable invoking Web sites to invoke payment request and receive payments silently.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Secure Communications</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/#security-considerations">Service Worker security considerations</a></li>
      <li>Payment method security is outside the scope of this specification and is addressed by payment handlers that support those payment methods.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Payment App Authenticity</h3>
    <p class="note">The Web Payments Working Group is also discussing
      Payment App authenticity; see the (draft) <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webpayments/proposals/Payment-Manifest-Proposal.html">Payment Method Manifest</a>.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Data Validation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Payees should validate that the data they have received through the paymentRequest API is what they expect (e.g., the total that was paid, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Private Browsing Mode</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>When the Payment Request API is invoked in a "private browsing mode," the user agent should launch payment handlers in a private context. This will generally prevent sites from accessing any previously-stored information. In turn, this is likely to require either that the user log in to the origin or re-enter payment instrument details.</li>
