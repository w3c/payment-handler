        Introduction

      <p>
        This specification defines a number of new features to allow web
        applications to handle requests for payments on behalf of users:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An origin-based permission to handle payment request events.
        </li>
        <li>A payment request event type (<a>PaymentRequestEvent</a>). A
        <a>payment handler</a> is an event handler for the
        <a>PaymentRequestEvent</a>.
        </li>
        <li>An extension to the service worker registration interface
        (<a>PaymentManager</a>) to manage the definition, display, and user
        selection of <a>PaymentInstrument</a>s.
        </li>
        <li>A mechanism to respond to the <a>PaymentRequestEvent</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
        This specification does not address how software built with
        operating-system specific mechanisms (i.e., "native apps") handle
        payment requests.

      <h2>
        Overview of Handling Payment Requests
      </h2>
      <p>
        In this document we envision the following flow:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>An origin requests permission from the user to handle payment
        requests for a set of supported payment methods. For example, a user
        visiting a retail or bank site may be prompted to register a payment
        handler from that origin. The origin establishes the scope of the
        permission but the origin's capabilities may evolve without requiring
        additional user consent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a>Payment handler</a>s are defined in <a>service worker</a> code.
        </li>
        <li>The <a>PaymentManager</a> is used to set a list of <a data-lt=
        "PaymentManager.instruments">payment instruments</a>. Each
          <a data-lt="PaymentInstrument">payment instrument</a> provides data
          to the user agent to improve the user experience of selecting payment
          credentials:
          <ul>
            <li>The <a data-lt="PaymentInstrument.method">method</a> and
            optional <a data-lt=
            "PaymentInstrument.capabilities">capabilities</a> inform the user
            agent decision whether to display this instrument as a candidate
            for payment.
            </li>
            <li>When the instrument matches what the payee accepts, the user
            agent may display the <a data-lt="PaymentInstrument.name">name</a>
            and <a data-lt="PaymentInstrument.icons">icon</a>. These provide
            hints about payment credentials that the user agent will return in
            the <a>PaymentHandlerResponse</a> if the user selects this
            instrument.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When the merchant (or other <dfn>payee</dfn>) calls the
        [[payment-request]] method <a>canMakePayment()</a> or <a>show()</a>
        (e.g., when the user pushes a button on a checkout page), the user
        agent computes a list of candidate payment handlers, comparing the
        payment methods accepted by the merchant with those supported by
        registered payment handlers. For payment methods that support
        additional filtering, either merchant and payment handler capabilities
        are compared or <a>CanMakePaymentEvent</a> is used as part of
        determining whether there is a match.
        </li>
        <li>The user agent displays a set of choices to the user: the
        registered <a data-lt="PaymentManager.instruments">instruments</a> of
        the candidate payment handlers. The user agent displays these choices
        using information (labels and icons) provided at registration or
        otherwise available from the Web app.
        </li>
        <li>When the user (the <dfn>payer</dfn>) selects an <a data-lt=
        "PaymentManager.instruments">instrument</a>, the user agent
        <a>fires</a> a <a>PaymentRequestEvent</a> (cf. the <a>user interaction
        task source</a>) in the service worker whose <a data-lt=
        "ServiceWorkerRegistration.paymentManager">PaymentManager</a> the
        instrument was registered with. The <a>PaymentRequestEvent</a> includes
        some information from the PaymentRequest (defined in
        [[!payment-request]]) as well as additional information (e.g., origin
        and selected instrument).
        </li>
        <li>Once activated, the payment handler performs whatever steps are
        necessary to <a href="#handling-a-payment-request">handle the payment
        request</a>, and return an appropriate payment response to the
        <a>payee</a>. If interaction with the user is necessary, the <a>payment
        handler</a> can open a window for that purpose.
        </li>
        <li>The user agent receives a response asynchronously once the payment
        handler has finished handling the request. The response becomes the
        PaymentResponse (of [[!payment-request]]).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="note">
        An origin may implement a payment app with more than one service worker
        and therefore multiple <a>payment handler</a>s may be registered per
        origin. The handler that is invoked is determined by the selection made
        by the user of a <a data-lt="PaymentManager.instruments">payment
        instrument</a>. The <a>service worker</a> which stored the <a data-lt=
        "PaymentManager.instruments">payment instrument</a> with its
        <a data-lt="ServiceWorkerRegistration.paymentManager">PaymentManager</a>
        is the one that will be invoked.

        <h2>
          Handling a Payment Request
        </h2>
        <p>
          A <dfn>payment handler</dfn> is a Web application that can handle a
          request for payment on behalf of the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          The logic of a payment handler is driven by the payment methods that
          it supports. Some payment methods, such as <a>basic-card</a> expect
          little to no processing by the payment handler which simply returns
          payment card details in the response. It is then the job of the payee
          website to process the payment using the returned data as input.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast, some payment methods, such as a crypto-currency payments
          or bank originated credit transfers, require that the payment handler
          initiate processing of the payment. In such cases the payment handler
          will return a payment reference, endpoint URL or some other data that
          the payee website can use to determine the outcome of the payment (as
          opposed to processing the payment itself).
        </p>
        <p>
          Handling a payment request may include numerous interactions: with
          the user through a new window or other APIs (such as
          [[!WebCryptoAPI]]) or with other services and origins through web
          requests or other means.
        </p>
        <p>
          This specification does not address these activities that occur
          between the payment handler accepting the <a>PaymentRequestEvent</a>
          and the payment handler returning a response. All of these activities
          which may be required to configure the payment handler and handle the
          payment request, are left to the implementation of the payment
          handler, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>how the user establishes an account with an origin that provides
          payment services.
          </li>
          <li>how an origin authenticates a user.
          </li>
          <li>how communication takes place between the payee server and the
          payee Web application, or between a payment app origin and other
          parties.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Thus, an origin will rely on many other Web technologies defined
          elsewhere for lifecycle management, security, user authentication,
          user interaction, and so on.

            This attribute allows manipulation of payment instruments
            associated with a service worker (and therefore its payment
            handler). To be a candidate payment handler, a handler must have at
            least one registered payment instrument to present to the user.
            That instrument needs to match the payment methods and required
            capabilities specified by the payment request.

            hint of "**** 1234" can remind the user that a particular card is
            available through this payment handler. When a agent displays all
            payment instruments available through a payment handler, it may
            cause confusion to display the additional hint.

        An invoked payment handler may or may not need to display information
        about itself or request user input. Some examples of potential payment
        handler display include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The payment handler opens a window for the user to provide an
        authorization code.
        </li>
        <li>The payment handler opens a window that makes it easy for the user
        to confirm payment using default information for that site provided
        through previous user configuration.
        </li>
        <li>When first selected to pay in a given session, the payment handler
        opens a window. For subsequent payments in the same session, the
        payment handler (through configuration) performs its duties without
        opening a window or requiring user interaction.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A <a>payment handler</a> that requires visual display and user
        interaction, may call openWindow() to display a page to the user.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Since user agents know that this method is connected to the

          interaction required to make a payment. At the same time, user agents
          must not permit combinations of configurations that would enable
          invoking Web sites to invoke payment request and receive payments
          silently.

          security reasons, the user agent should provide rationale to the
          payment handler developers (e.g., through console messages) and may
          also inform the user to help avoid confusion.

          <li>When the Payment Request API is invoked in a "private browsing
          mode," the user agent should launch payment handlers in a private
          context. This will generally prevent sites from accessing any
          previously-stored information. In turn, this is likely to require
          either that the user log in to the origin or re-enter payment
          instrument details.

          <li>The <a>CanMakePaymentEvent</a> event should not be fired in

        Payment Handler Display Considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        When ordering payment handlers and payment instruments, the user agent
        is expected to honor user preferences over other preferences. User
        agents are expected to permit manual configuration options, such as
        setting a preferred payment handler or instrument display order for an
        origin, or for all origins.
