  <p>Payment Request API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] provides
    a standard way to initiate payment requests from Web pages and
    applications. User agents implementing that API prompt the user
    to select a way to handle the payment request, after which
    the user agent returns a payment response to the originating site.
    This specification adds <strong>payment apps</strong>
    to that user experience. It defines how users
    register payment apps with user agents, how user agents present
    information about payment apps the user can select to handle the
    payment request, how the user selects a payment app, and how communication takes
    place between user agents and payment apps to fulfill the requirements of the
    underlying Payment Request API.</p>

    <p>The Web Payments Working Group maintains <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-payment-apps-api/issues">

        This draft highlights some of the pending issues that are still to
        be discussed in the working group. No decision has been taken on
        the outcome of these issues including whether they are valid. Pull
        requests with proposed specification text for outstanding issues
        are strongly encouraged.</p>

<section class='informative'>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The Web Payments Working Group seeks to streamline payments on the Web to
  help reduce payment "abandonment" and make it easier to use
  new payment methods on the Web. It has published the Payment Request
  API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] as a standard way to initiate payment
  requests from Web pages and applications. This specification adds
    payment apps to that user experience. A payment app is software that
    enables the user to fulfill a payment request using the user's
    preferred payment method.</p>

    <p>This specification defines:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How users register and unregister payment apps with the user agent (or other "mediator" that implements Payment Request API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]]).</li>
      <li>How the user agent matches payment methods supported by the payee with those enabled in registered payment apps.</li>
      <li>How merchants and other payees may recommend payment apps to the user.</li>
      <li>How the user agent presents information about payment apps to the user for selection.</li>
      <li>How the user agent invokes a payment app, communicates input/response data with it, and returns the response data to the underlying Payment Request API.</li>
    </ul>

  <p> Payment apps may be implemented in a variety of ways: as Web applications, native operating system applications,
    user agent extensions, built-in user agent components, interface-less Web services, or a combination. The scope of this specification is Web-based payment apps, which are implemented as service workers.</p>
</section>
<section id='conformance'>
    <p>
        This specification defines one class of products:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>Conforming user agent</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                A <a>user agent</a> MUST behave as described in this specification
                in order to be considered conformant. In this specification, <a>user agent</a> means a <em>Web
                browser or other interactive user agent</em> as defined in [[!HTML5]].
            </p>
            <p>
                User agents MAY implement algorithms given in this
                specification in any way desired, so long as the end result is
                indistinguishable from the result that would be obtained by the
                specification's algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
                A conforming Payment App API user agent MUST also be a
                <em>conforming implementation</em> of the IDL fragments
                of this specification, as described in the
                “Web IDL” specification. [[!WEBIDL]]
            </p>

            <aside class="note">
                This specification uses both the terms "conforming user agent(s)"
                and "user agent(s)" to refer to this product class.

  <h2>Payment App Model and Design Considerations</h2>
  <p>This section describes the capabilities and limitations of this specification in functional terms.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>General Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>This specification builds on PaymentRequest API.</li>
      <li>It defines mechanisms that may be used to support Web-based payment apps. We anticipate that various platforms will offer proprietary alternatives to this specification (e.g., for payment app registration or invocation). Proprietary payment apps lie outside the scope of this specification.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Decoupling and Trust</h3>
    <ul>
<li>    A goal of this system is to decouple the payment methods used to pay from the software (payment apps) that implement those payment methods. By decoupling, merchants (and their payment service providers) can lower the cost of creating a checkout experience, users can have more choice in the software they use to pay, and payment app providers can innovate without imposing an integration burden on merchants.</li>
<li>User choice of payment apps that support a given payment method will depend in part on the willingness of the payment method owner to authorize other parties to implement their payment methods. For example, there may only be one payment app authorized to support a payment method owned by a company, while there may be many apps that support basic credit card payments or credit transfers.</li>
<li>    For privacy, we seek to limit information about the user's environment available to merchants without user consent. That includes which payment apps the user has registered. The merchant should not receive information about which payment app the user selected to pay unless the user consents to share that information. (When there is only one payment app for a given payment method that information is already publicly known.)</li>
<li>    Although decoupling relieves merchants of implementing some aspects of the checkout experience, one consequence is that they give up some degree of control. This was already the case for some payment methods, but for traditional card payments, merchants (or their PSPs) will be entrusting some portion of data collection to the user agent or third party payment apps.</li>
<li>The design therefore includes support for merchants to <a href="#summary-recommended-apps">recommend payment apps</a> and suggest the display order of payment methods. This specification does not constrain how user agents make use of this information, but provides guidance to user agent developers about taking into account both merchant and user preferences. </li>
<li> The user agent may use this combined preference information to:
  <ul>
    <li>   Filter payment apps (to matching payment methods)</li>
<li>        Order payment apps (according to merchant-specified order)</li>
<li>        Display recommended payment apps (according to merchant-specified order)</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Identification</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A Payment App is identified by a Payment App Identifier (PAI).</li>
      <li>This specification defines service-worker based payment apps. The PAI is the service worker's “script URL” that, when dereferenced, returns the code of the service worker. <p class="issue">See a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-payment-apps-api/issues/48#issuecomment-261775283">counter-proposal</a> as part of <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-payment-apps-api/issues/48">issue 48</a></p></li>
      <li>The user agent may make use of the origin information of the PAI in a variety of ways, including:
	<ul>
	  <li>        The origin information could enable user agents to provide the user with useful services when the user is browsing a site with the same origin (e.g., putting that payment app at the top of a list or otherwise highlighted).</li>
	  <li>        For a payment method with an associated origin, the user agent can do some (security) checks by comparing the origin of the payment method and any authorized payment app.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>	
    </ul>

    <h3>Registration and Unregistration</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Registration provides a way for user agents to remain aware of the user's payment apps across transactions.</li>
      <li>A payment app that follows this specification must be registered
	before it can be used to make a payment. 
	<strong>Note:</strong> Registration is not
	necessarily a prerequisite to be able to use other types
	of payment apps (e.g., native payment apps).</li>
      <li>In this specification, payment app registration starts with service
      worker registration. Once the user consents to the registration, the
      payment app provides information to the browser about enabled payment
      methods and associated information; this is used for matching with
      payee-accepted payment methods. At this point, the payment app is
      registered with the user agent. <strong>Note:</strong>  Registration
      does <strong>not</strong> refer to how the user establishes a
      relationship with the payment app provider, for example by setting up an
      account with that provider.</li>
      <li>We expect registrations to happen at various times (e.g., outside and inside of checkout), and with differing levels of
          user consent to modify their configuration within the user agent. In general, explicit consent should not be required
          while the user is within the context of the payment request UI. Here are some examples:
        <ul>
          <li>Users visiting a Web site (e.g., merchant or bank) may wish to explicitly register payment apps, which would require explicit consent from the user.</li>
          <li>When the user selects a recommended payment app the user agent registers the payment app and may do so without additional user action or consent.</li>
          <li>When the user installs native payment app, registration could happen either through platform-specific mechanisms or through this standard API, without additional user action beyond installation.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>This specification does require payment apps to be able to respond to user agent queries for updated
          registration information. (See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-payment-apps-api/issues/36">issue 36</a>.)</li>
      <li>It is important for merchants and users to be able to trust the
	authenticity of payment apps. A starting point is to rely on origin information (e.g., if a payment app is registered on a Web site). In contexts where origin binding is unavailable or insufficient, other mechanisms should be considered to help establish authenticity (e.g., origin-bound confirmation of a digital signature of a payment app).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3 id="summary-recommended-apps">Recommended Payment Apps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Payees may recommend payment apps that may be used for a given transaction. In some cases the user may have already registered these payment apps.</li>
      <li>To recommend a payment app, a merchant provides a payment app identifier (PAI), name, and icon information. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-payment-apps-api/issues/79">issue 79</a> for discussion about how this may be done.</li>
      <li>When the user agent presents a recommended (unregistered) payment app for selection by the user, it uses merchant-provided information.</li>
      <li>In the case where the user has already registered a recommended payment app, the user agent may use merchant-provided
	information to complement information available from the
	payment app or to present that payment app for
	selection in some special manner.
	<strong>Note:</strong> The Working Group
	is still discussing the display of information in the case
	of recommended payment apps already registered by the user.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Payment App Matching and Selection</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>When the user invokes the Payment Request API (e.g., by "pushing the Buy button"), the user agent presents a list of "matching" payment apps to the user for selection. Matching payment apps are those recommended by the merchant, and those registered by the user that support the merchant's accepted payment methods (including finer-grain acceptance filters from the merchant).</li>
      <li>In the case of a recommended payment app already registered by the user (determined by comparison of payment app identifiers), the user agent may present the app in some special way to highlight the merchant's recommendation.</li>
      <li>When the user selects a recommended unregistered payment app, the user agent registers it, using the provided payment app identifier to access the service worker code.</li>
      <li>The user agent may offer features to facilitate selection. For example, instead of merely displaying information about a payment app that supports cards, the user agent could display some representation of individual cards stored in the payment app. If the user can select an option directly, that could contribute to reducing the total number of required user actions. User agents might also enable the user to optimize payments using certain payment apps on certain Web sites. User experience optimizations such as these lie outside the scope of this specification.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Payment App Invocation and Response</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Once the user has selected a payment app, the user agent activates the associated service worker code and provides the payment app with
        input data drawn from the Payment Request API. </li>
      <li>The user may interact with the payment app in a variety of ways to authorize payment, cancel the transaction,
          or carry out other activities supported by the payment app.</li>
      <li>This specification defines a means for the user agent to receive a response asynchronously once the user has
          authorized payment. The response becomes the response of the Payment Request API.</li>
      <li>This specification only describes communication between the
        user agent and the payment app. This includes an
        asynchronous mechanism for a payment app to return a payment
        response to the user agent. This specification does not address communication between the payee server and the payee Web app, or between
        the payment app and other parties (e.g., the payment app distributor, or directly to the merchant).</li>

  <h2>Overview of Service-Worker-Based Approach</h2>

<p>In this specification we use <a>service workers</a>
    to connect user agents with user agent-based payment apps. We do so for
    several reasons:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Service workers provide a cleanly isolated execution context that allows
        the <a>payment app</a> to run with clean separation from the
        <a>payee</a> website.
      </li>
      <li>We can leverage the ways in which service workers already
          handle lifecycle management (registration, update, and removal of
          <a>payment apps</a>), enable offline use, etc.</li>
      <li>We can leverage service worker origins for security, especially
          when used in conjunction with origins associated with <a>payment
          method identifiers</a>.</li>
    </ul>

<p class="note">
  The use of service workers restricts <a>user agent-based payment apps</a> so
  that they must run only in secure contexts. The introduction of this
  restriction is deliberate, due to the sensitivity of the role that payment
  apps play. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-payment-apps-api/issues/24">issue 24</a> for information about launching the payment app in a secure context.
</p>

<p>Here is the flow envisioned by this document:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A <a>service worker</a> is registered and associates
        <a>payment methods</a> (and associated metadata) with the payment app.</li>
    <li>When the <code>payment request API</code> is called, the user agent
        displays a list of registered service workers associated
        with matching payment methods (along with any other payment apps
        that may be available to the user agent).</li>
    <lI>When the user selects a <a>user agent-based payment
        app</a>, the corresponding <a>service worker</a> is activated, and
        it receives a <a>PaymentRequestEvent</a>.</li>
    <li>Once active, the <a>payment app</a> performs whatever steps are
        necessary to authenticate the user, process the payment, and return
        payment information to the <a>payee</a>. If interaction with the user
        is necessary, the <a>payment app</a> can open a <a>payment app
        window</a> for that purpose.</li>
    <li>Finally, once the <a>payment app</a> is finished with its processing, it
        resolves a <a>Promise</a> passed to it in the event. This causes the
        <code>Promise&lt;PaymentResponse&gt;</code> returned from
        <code>PaymentRequest.show()</code> to resolve.</li>
  </ol>

      Extensions to the <a>ServiceWorkerRegistration</a> interface
    </h3>
      <p>
        The Service Worker specification defines a <code>ServiceWorkerRegistration</code> interface
        [[!SERVICE-WORKERS]], which this specification extends.

      };
      </pre>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>options</code> attribute</dt>
      <dd>
        This attribute allows manipulation of payment options associated with a
        payment app. To be presented to the user as part of the payment request
        flow, payment apps must have at least one registered payment option, and
        that option needs to match the payment methods and required capabilities
        specified by the payment request.
        <p class="issue">Is "options" the right term here? We don't want this to
        get conflated with "PaymentOptions" in the payment request
        specification. Other alternatives might be "instruments" or "accounts."
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt><code>wallets</code> attribute</dt>
      <dd>
        This attribute allows payment apps to group payment options together and
        provide a name and icon for such a group (e.g., to group together
        "business account" payment instruments separately from "personal
        account" payment instruments). The use of this grouping mechanism
        by payment apps is completley optional. If payment apps use this
        grouping mechanism, then matching payment options that do not appear
        in any groups should still be presented to users by the browser for
        selection.

    Payment App Display
  </h3>

  <p>An invoked payment app may or may not need to display information
    about itself or request user input. Some examples of potential
    payment app displays include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The payment app opens a window for the user to provide an authorization code.</li>
    <li>The payment app opens a window that makes it easy for the user to confirm payment using default information for that site provided through previous user configuration.</li>
    <li>When first selected to pay in a given session, the payment app
      opens a window. For subsequent payments in the same session, the payment app (through configuration) performs its duties without opening a window or requiring user interaction.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To support scenarios that involve visual display and user interaction, user agents MUST allow payment apps to call the <code>clients.openWindow()</code> method defined in [[!SERVICE-WORKERS]]. Because user agents can determine from event type that the window is part of a payment flow, the user agent SHOULD render the window in a way that is consistent with the flow and not confusing to the user. For example, we recommend that the payment app <em>not</em> be opened in a new browser tab, as this is too dissociated from the checkout context.</p>
  
  <p>[[!SERVICE-WORKERS]] expects a user interaction to have occurred in order to open a Window. This user interaction is obvious when the user explicitly selects a payment app to make a payment. However, when user agent or payment app configuration allows payment app invocation without explicit user selection, the user agent MUST consider the <a>paymentrequest</a> event as the relevant user interaction for a <code>clients.openWindow()</code> request.</p>

  <p>User agents SHOULD display the origin of a running payment app to the user.</p>

  <div class="issue">
  <p><a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-payment-apps-api/issues/73">Issue 73</a> asks whether it is possible to close a window open via clients.openWindow() programmatically.</p>

  <div class="note">
    <p><em>The remainder of this section is currently a non-normative explanation of how
    the service worker <code>WindowClient</code> class can be used to interact
    with users.</em></p>
    <p>
      Upon calling clients.openWindow(), the payment app receives a
      <a>Promise</a> which resolves to a <code>WindowClient</code>. For the
      purposes of this discussion, we will refer to this
      <code>WindowClient</code> as <var>client</var>.  The payment app can use
      the <var>client</var>.<code>postMessage()</code> method to send messages
      to the <a>payment app window</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a <a>payment app window</a> receives the <code>message</code> event
      from the payment app, this event will contain a <code>source</code>
      attribute which indicates the payment app's service worker. The payment
      app window can then call <code>source.postMessage()</code> to send a
      response to the payment app. Once the payment app window has complete its
      interaction with the user, it closes the window and uses this
      <code>postMessage()</code> call to return information to the payment app.
    </p>
    <p class="issue">
      In order for this approach to work, we have to treat a
      <a>paymentrequest</a> as permission to open a popup, which is a formal
      property relied up on by [[!SERVICE-WORKERS]]. We need to be careful
      that this does not become an end-run around exiting pop-up protections.
    </p>
    <p class="issue">
      Do we want to define a new <code>FrameType</code> for <a>payment app
      window</a>s? This requires input from someone with detailed knowledge of
      service worker design.

    <h3>Payment App Response</h3>
    <p>
      The user agent receives a successful response from the payment app
      through resolution of the Promise provided to the <code>respondWith</code>
      function of the corresponding <a>PaymentRequestEvent</a> dictionary.
      The application is expected to resolve the Promise with a
      <code>PaymentAppResponse</code> instance containing the
      payment response. In case of user cancellation or error, the
      application may signal failure by rejecting the Promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Promise is rejected, the user agent MUST run the <dfn>payment app
      failure algorithm</dfn>. The exact details of this algorithm is left for
      user agent implementers to decide on. Acceptable behaviors include,
      but are not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Letting the user try again, with the same payment app or with a
        different one.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rejecting the Promise that was created by
        <code>PaymentRequest.show()</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If this Promise is successfully resolved, the user agent MUST run the
      <a>user accepts the payment request algorithm</a> as defined in
      [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]], replacing steps 6 and 7 with these steps or
      their equivalent:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Set <var>appResponse</var> to the <code>PaymentAppResponse</code>
        instance used to resolve the
        <a>PaymentRequestEvent</a><code>.respondWith</code> Promise.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>appResponse</var>.<code>methodName</code> is not present or
        not set to one of the values from
        <a>PaymentRequestEvent</a>.<code>appRequest</code>, run the <a>payment app
        failure algorithm</a> and terminate these steps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a <a>structured clone</a> of
        <var>appResponse</var>.<code>methodName</code>
        and assign it to
        <var>response</var>.<code>methodName</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>appResponse</var>.<code>details</code> is not present, run the
        <a>payment app failure algorithm</a> and terminate these steps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a <a>structured clone</a> of
        <var>appResponse</var>.<code>details</code>
        and assign it to
        <var>response</var>.<code>details</code>.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The following example shows how to respond to a payment request:</p>
    <pre class="example highlight" title="Sending a Payment Response">
      paymentRequestEvent.respondWith(new Promise(function(accept,reject) {
        /* ... processing may occur here ... */
        accept({
          methodName: "basic-card#visa",
          details: {
            card_number :  "1232343451234",
            expiry_month : "12",
            expiry_year :  "2020",
            cvv :          "123"
           }
        });
      });
    </pre>

    <p class="note">
      [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] defines a <code>paymentRequestID</code>
	that parties in the ecosystem (including payment app providers
	and payees) may use for reconciliation after network or other
	failures.</p>

      <h3>Example of handling the <code>paymentrequest</code> event</h3>
    <p>
      This example shows how to write a service worker that listens to the
      paymentrequest event. When a payment request event is received, the
      service worker opens a window in order to interact with the user.
    </p>
    <pre class="example highlight" title="Handling the paymentrequest event"
    id="example-paymentrequest-event">
      self.addEventListener('paymentrequest', function(e) {
        e.respondWith(new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
          self.addEventListener('message', listener = function(e) {
            self.removeEventListener('message', listener);
            if (e.data.hasOwnProperty('name')) {
              reject(e.data);
            } else {
              resolve(e.data);
            }
          });

          clients.openWindow("https://www.example.com/bobpay/pay")
          .then(function(windowClient) {
            windowClient.postMessage(e.data);
          })
          .catch(function(err) {
            reject(err);
          });
        }));
      });
    </pre>
    <p>Using the simple scheme described above, a trivial HTML page that is
    loaded into the <a>payment app window</a> to implement the <em>basic
    card</em> scheme might look like the following:</p>
    <pre class="example highlight" title="Simple Payment App Window">
&lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;form id="form"&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Cardholder Name:&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input name="cardholderName"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Card Number:&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input name="cardNumber"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Expiration Month:&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input name="expiryMonth"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Expiration Year:&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input name="expiryYear"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Security Code:&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input name="cardSecurityCode"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Pay"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
window.addEventListener("message", function(e) {
  var form = document.getElementById("form");
  /* Note: message sent from payment app is available in e.data */
  form.onsubmit = function() {
    /* See https://w3c.github.io/webpayments-methods-card/#basiccardresponse */
    var basicCardResponse = {};
    [ "cardholderName", "cardNumber","expiryMonth","expiryYear","cardSecurityCode"]
    .forEach(function(field) {
      basicCardResponse[field] = form.elements[field].value;
    });

    /* See https://w3c.github.io/webpayments-payment-apps-api/#sec-app-response */
    var paymentAppResponse = {
      methodName: "basic-card",
      details: details
    };

    e.source.postMessage(paymentAppResponse);
    window.close();
  }
});
&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;

  <h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>Information about the User Environment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The API does not share information about the user's registered payment methods or payment apps with the payee. The only information that is shared is the result of user selection.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>User Consent before Payment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>One goal of this specification is to minimize the user interaction required to make a payment. At the same time, user agents must not permit combinations of configurations that would enable invoking Web sites to invoke payment request and receive payments silently.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Secure Communications</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/#security-considerations">Service Worker security considerations</a></li>
      <li>Payment method security is outside the scope of this specification and is addressed by payment apps that support those payment methods.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Payment App Authenticity</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To avoid problems such as phishing-type attacks on payee sites, we want to be able to ensure the authenticity of payment apps. In general we expect to rely on origin information for establishing payment app authenticity. In contexts where payment apps are referenced other than on their origin, we are considering additional measures to help establish authenticity. Examples: validate a digital signature prior to launching a recommended app or a registered payment app without associated origin information.</li>
      <li><span class="note">Note: More work is required on good practice so that it is easy for users to use trusted apps (e.g., white listing by the browser or merchant) and hard to use risky apps (e.g., warnings to the user and explicit user overrides as done today with untrusted certificates).</span></li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Data Validation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Payees should validate that the data they have received through the paymentRequest API is what they expect (e.g., the total that was paid, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Private Browsing Mode</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>When the Payment Request API is invoked in a "private browsing mode," the user agent should launch user agent-based payment apps in a private context. This will generally prevent sites from accessing any previously-stored information. In turn, this is likely to require either that the user log in to the payment app or re-enter payment instrument details.</li>
